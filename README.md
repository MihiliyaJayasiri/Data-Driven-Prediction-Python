# Data-Driven Prediction Using Python

## Overview
This repository contains an individual university coursework project completed for
the module **Programming (5FTC2150)**. The project focuses on designing and evaluating
a data-driven prediction solution using Python.

## Objectives
- Select and analyse a real-world dataset (1000+ records)
- Clean and structure data using Python
- Implement two prediction approaches:
  - Rule-based prediction
  - Statistical prediction (Ridge Regression)
- Evaluate prediction performance using error metrics
- Visualise trends and prediction results

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Prediction Methods
1. **Rule-Based Model**
   - Uses conditional logic and thresholds
2. **Statistical Model**
   - Rigde regression
   - Linear regression
   - Evaluated using MAE / MSE

## Repository Contents
- `src/` – Python source code
- `report.pdf` – Formal academic report
- `presentation.pdf` – Coursework presentation
- `data/` – Dataset used for analysis

## Academic Note
This is an individual take-home coursework completed during the 2nd Year 1st Sem (2025) academic year.
